Current Process Description
The current data integration process for handling CSV files received by email from the business involves two separate Unity tickets:

The first ticket is used to request the placement of the file in the appropriate UNIX directory.

The second ticket is used to request the execution of the shell script, with the necessary parameters, which will then load the data into the appropriate table.

This process is time-consuming and inefficient due to its dependency on the gestionnaire, who must manually handle each Unity ticket. For this reason, we are currently working on an improved solution, as described in the comment above.
