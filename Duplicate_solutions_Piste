Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to allow business teams to place CSV files directly into the Datalab environment, named (...). We already have the necessary permissions with the appropriate user to write files to this location.

From there, using the admin user of the PILAT application, we would access the files in the Datalab and insert the data into the target tables located in another schema (PILAT).

However, since we do not currently have the required access rights to perform this operation, we are submitting this request to obtain the necessary permissions.
