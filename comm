Following our discussions and the initial volume discrepancies observed, I have conducted an in-depth verification to ensure everything is in order.

I thoroughly analyzed the credit indicator feeding process, tracing the data from staging to the final table used for dashboard reporting. Everything appears to be consistent at each step.
I also considered the points you mentioned, particularly the fact that some data from the January 2025 cut-off may not have been present in the February 3 snapshot (as the monthly processing might not have occurred yet).
The data copied in snapshot mode seems to accurately reflect the expected state and should allow the tests to proceed under good conditions.
Based on these elements, I consider the tests on my side to be complete, and I validate the data consistency for the next steps of the project.

Let me know if this works for you or if you need me to perform any additional verification.

Thanks,
